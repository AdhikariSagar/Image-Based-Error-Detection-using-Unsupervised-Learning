# Image-based-error-detection-using-unsupervised-learning

This repository explores the implementation of image-based error detection using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to develop a robust system that can automatically identify errors or anomalies in images without relying on labeled training data.
## Approach

The project employs unsupervised learning techniques, such as Convoluation autoencoders and Variational Autoencoder, anomaly detection algorithms, to train the model on the given dataset without labeled error instances. The trained model can then identify deviations from the normal patterns in new images, indicating potential errors.
